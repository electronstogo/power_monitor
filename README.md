# power_monitor
Device that measures the current, power, and work of electronic devices and shows a graph of the course of current.

The button on the right side can be touched to start / stop a measurement session.



The display shows the following values:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- I --> Current from recent measurement.
- Imax --> Maximum current measured in the running session.
- U --> Voltage from recent measurement.
- P --> Power from recent measurement.
- W --> Consumed work of consumer in the running session.


The graph shows the course of the consumed current. The scaling of the graph will be adusted automatically, depending on the measured current level.
